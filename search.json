    "section": "Conclusion",
    "text": "Conclusion\nThe analysis integrates insights from both a multiple linear regression model and Granger causality tests to assess the influence of various macroeconomic indicators on Bitcoin prices.\nFrom the linear regression model, several predictors showed statistically significant relationships with Bitcoin price. Most notably, the Dow Jones Index exhibited a strong positive association (p &lt; 0.001), suggesting that increases in stock market performance correlate with higher Bitcoin prices. 10 Year Treasury Yield had a significant negative effect (p &lt; 0.001), indicating that higher interest rates may dampen Bitcoin demand, possibly due to rising opportunity costs. DXY (Dollar Index) also showed a significant negative effect (p = 0.005), implying that Bitcoin tends to decline as the U.S. dollar strengthens. Meanwhile, M2 money supply had a moderate positive effect (p ≈ 0.049), suggesting liquidity expansion may support Bitcoin valuation. Other variables like Consumer Price Index, Federal Funds Rate, Unemployment Rate, and Gold Price did not exhibit statistically significant impacts in the regression model.\nIn contrast, the Granger causality analysis, which captures predictive relationships over time, revealed that 10 Year Treasury Yield Granger-cause Bitcoin price (p = 0.032), confirming their temporal influence. M2 money supply (p = 0.094) and U.S. Dollar Index (p = 0.072) provided weak evidence of predictive power at the 10% significance level, but other indicators including the Dow Jones, despite its strong regression coefficient, did not Granger-cause Bitcoin price. This implies that while these factors may co-move with Bitcoin (as seen in regression), they do not necessarily have predictive power over Bitcoin’s future movements."

    "text": "Estimating the price of Bitcoin is more difficult than valuing stocks or bonds because it lacks intrinsic cash flows, is driven by speculative demand, and is highly sensitive to volatile sentiment and regulatory shifts. This project aims to investigate whether macroeconomic indicators—such as economic statistics, stock indices, bond rates, and currency strength—can serve as reliable references for identifying trends in Bitcoin’s price direction. By analyzing historical data and exploring correlations, the study seeks to understand if Bitcoin behaves similarly to traditional financial assets or exhibits unique drivers. The goal is to determine whether these conventional metrics offer predictive value in the context of cryptocurrency markets. The macroeconomic indicators that were chosen for in depth analysis in this project were Federal Funds Rate,Consumer Price Index, U.S. Dollar Index, M2 Money Supply, Gold Price, Unemployment Rate, 10 Year Treasury Yield and Dow Jones Index where Consumer Price Index, Federal Funds Rate, U.S. Dollar Index,M2 Money Supply, Unemployment Rate were collected from https://fred.stlouisfed.org/ and Bitcoin Price, 10 Year Treasury Yield and Dow Jones Index, Gold Price were collected from https://finance.yahoo.com/. All source data were merged into single data set where estimation of coefficients, p-values, and confident intervals were computed by fitting them into linear regression models."
